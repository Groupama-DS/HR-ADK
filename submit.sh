# BASH SCRIPT TO BUILD AND DEPLOY A DOCKER CONTAINER TO GOOGLE CLOUD RUN
# ==============================================================================
#
# This script automates the following steps:
#   1. Builds a Docker image from the local Dockerfile.
#   2. Pushes the image to Google Artifact Registry.
#   3. Deploys the image to Google Cloud Run, assigning a secure service
#      account identity for authentication with other Google Cloud services.
#
# USAGE:
#   1. Make sure you have the following installed:
#      - Google Cloud SDK (gcloud): `gcloud auth login`
#      - Docker
#   2. Ensure your user account (the one running this script) has the
#      required IAM roles on the project:
#      - Artifact Registry Writer (`roles/artifactregistry.writer`)
#      - Cloud Run Admin (`roles/run.admin`)
#      - Service Account User (`roles/iam.serviceAccountUser`)
#   3. Ensure the resources below have been created (one-time setup):
#      - An Artifact Registry repository.
#      - A runtime service account for the Cloud Run service.
#      - A secret in Secret Manager for the Flask secret key.
#   4. Ensure the runtime service account has the necessary IAM roles to
#      access other services (e.g., `roles/storage.objectAdmin` for GCS).
#   5. Fill in the variables in the "USER-CONFIGURABLE VARIABLES" section below.
#   6. Make the script executable: `chmod +x deploy.sh`
#   7. Run the script from your project root: `./deploy.sh`
#
